# Graph-Generation-using-Multi-Agent-LLM-Models-to-Derive-Space-Insights-SmartViz
This repository contains the implementation of a multi-agent chatbot system developed as part of my MSc Dissertation project at Aston University. The system enables natural language queries to be translated into SQL, generate appropriate graphs/visualizations, and produce contextual insights using Large Language Models (LLMs).
